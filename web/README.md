# Emergency Personnel Reporting Web Application

A single solution for reporting employee and business continuity impacts to Provincial Emergency Coordination Centre (PECC) and NRM Policy Group (NRM Executive Committees). More details can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ku9tJ34=/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10.x and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

Note: We are using Node 10 as a base image on our pipeline.

### Installing

In the project directory, run:

#### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies in the node_modules folder.

### Executing program

In the project directory, create `.env` file at root using `.env.example` as a sample, then you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

##### Running the application in production mode on Docker:

In the project directory,

1. Build a docker image by running `docker build -t epr-web .`
2. Run `docker run --env-file .env.docker -p 3000:3000 --rm epr-web:latest`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
